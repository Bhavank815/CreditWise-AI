CardClarity AI: A Credit Card Assistant
Overview
CardClarity AI is an intelligent credit card assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to provide context-aware answers to user queries. By integrating LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, and Groq LLM, this application retrieves relevant information from multiple sources and generates precise, context-based answers.

The assistant is designed to simplify credit card-related queries, offering users clarity and actionable insights by processing data from user-provided URLs.

Features
Multi-Source Document Retrieval: Retrieves relevant information from multiple sources using FAISS vector stores.

Generative AI Integration: Uses Groq LLM to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

Multi-Query Enhancement: Generates multiple variations of user queries to improve retrieval accuracy.

Document Chunking: Splits large documents into manageable chunks for efficient embedding and retrieval.

Context-Based Responses: Ensures answers are strictly derived from the provided context, avoiding external knowledge.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages:
Python

Frameworks & Libraries:
Streamlit for the user interface

LangChain for RAG pipeline implementation

Hugging Face Transformers for embeddings

FAISS for vector-based similarity search

Groq LLM for generative AI

Other Tools:
PostgreSQL for data storage (if needed)

JSON for saving retrieved documents

AWS Lambda (optional) for scalable deployment

File Descriptions
credit_card_assistant_app.py: Main Streamlit application for the Credit Card Assistant.

vectorstore_service.py: Handles vector store creation and multi-source retrieval using FAISS.

multi_query_generation.py: Implements multi-query generation techniques to enhance document retrieval.

data_chunk_splitter.py: Splits large documents into smaller chunks for embedding and processing.

rag_assistant.py: Core logic of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based assistant.

requirements.txt: Lists all dependencies required to run the project.

Installation
Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

An OpenAI API key or Groq API key (for LLM integration).

Install PostgreSQL if you plan to use it as a database.

Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CardClarityAI.git
cd CardClarityAI
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project directory with the following keys:

text
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
Run the application:

bash
python credit_card_assistant_app.py
How It Works
Users enter URLs containing credit card-related information into the sidebar of the Streamlit application.

The assistant processes these URLs by:

Loading documents from the URLs using WebBaseLoader.

Splitting documents into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Creating embeddings with Hugging Face models and storing them in FAISS vector stores.

When a user submits a query, the assistant:

Generates alternative query perspectives using MultiQueryTechnique.

Retrieves relevant documents from the vector store.

Uses Groq LLM with strict context-based prompts to generate accurate answers.

The assistant displays the answer along with sources used for generating it.

Usage Example
Launch the application:

bash
python credit_card_assistant_app.py
Enter URLs containing credit card details in the sidebar (e.g., terms and conditions pages, FAQs).

Submit a query like:

text
What is the cashback policy for this credit card?
View the generated answer along with its sources.
